## Steps to reproduce

### Successfully adds preview URLs to Auth authorized domains

1. Add the Service Usage Consumer('roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer') role to the service account
1. Create a PR
   - This should correctly add the preview URL to Auth authorized domains

### Fails when adding preview URLs to Auth authorized domains

1. Remove the Service Usage Consumer('roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer') role from the service account
1. Create a PR
   - This does add the preview URL to Auth authorized domains

## Notes

Cannot get error logs from GitHub actions. Try to simulate locally using the ff conditions:

1. No user is logged in
   - Run `firebase logout`
1. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to your service account
   - Run `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_service_account>`

Error logs from running `firebase hosting:channel:deploy --expires 1d <channel_id> --project some-testproject --debug`

## Hypothesis

Adding the role 'roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer' to the service account during the `firebase init hosting:github` process should grant the service account permission to use enabled Google Cloud services(?).

-- Verified this behavior. Adding the role during `firebase init hosting:github` does seem to fix the issue
